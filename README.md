## Overview

A Python package that provides access to data in the Complete Journey
Study provided by [84.51°](http://www.8451.com). The data represents
grocery store shopping transactions over one year from a group of 2,469
households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of
each household’s purchases, not just those from a limited number of
categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as
direct marketing contact history are included. The data sets provided by
`completejourney` include:

  - `transactions`: products purchased by households
  - `products`: product metadata (brand, description, etc.)
  - `demographics`: household demographic data (age, income, family
    size, etc.)
  - `campaigns`: campaigns received by each household
  - `campaign_descriptions`: campaign metadata (length of time active)
  - `coupons`: coupon metadata (UPC code, campaign, etc.)
  - `coupon_redemptions`: coupon redemptions (household, day, UPC code,
    campaign)
  - `promotions`: product placement in mailers and in stores
    corresponding to advertising campaigns
